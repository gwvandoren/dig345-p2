      <p> This website is my Project 2: Utility assignment for the class
        DIG345: Radical Software at Davidson College. For context,
        an additional class assignment was to read a book of our choosing.
        My book was "The Culture of Surveillance" by David Lyon.</p>
      <p> The goal of this website is to allow Davidson
        students to email CatCard Services, request their locational swipe data,
        then upload this data file to visualize the access points at which
        the student swiped at on a map of Davidsonâ€™s campus. There is a slider
        which allows the student to see their swipe locational data over time. </p>
      <p> The purpose behind this website is to offer Davidson students a visualization
        of their CatCard locational data that is not viewable on the CatCard portal.
        Davidson does not have a visualization of this data either, however, they record
        this data in a third-party database and have the capability to produce a report of
        this data, which is a form of surveillance. With this website, I hope to prompt
        students to think about how this data can be used by Davidson and what kind of
        stories this data can tell about a student.</p>
