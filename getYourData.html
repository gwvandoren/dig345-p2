  <p> Subject: Request for CatCard Data</p>
  <p> Message: Dear CatCard Services,
    I am emailing to request my personal CatCard locational data
    (card swipe data). Since it is my personal data, I do not need
    to sign a FERPA waiver. I would only like my swipe data for one
    day, it does not matter which day it is. Thank you and have a good one!
  </p>
