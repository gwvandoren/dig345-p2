        <p> This website is my Project 2: Utility assignment for the class
          DIG345: Radical Software at Davidson College. For context,
          an additional class assignment was to read a book of our choosing.
          My book was "The Culture of Surveillance" by David Lyon.</p>
        <p> The goal of this website is to allow Davidson
          students to email CatCard Services, request their locational swipe data,
          then upload this data file to visualize the access points at which
          the student swiped at on a map of Davidsonâ€™s campus. There is a slider
          which allows the student to see their locational swipe data over time. </p>
        <p> The purpose behind this website is to offer Davidson students a visualization
          of their CatCard locational data that is not available on the CatCard portal
          accessible to us. Davidson does not have a visualization of this data either,
          however, they record this data and keep it in a third-party database, which is
          a form of surveillance. With this website, I hope to prompt students to think
          about how this data can be used by Davidson and what kind of stories the data
          can tell about a student.</p>
